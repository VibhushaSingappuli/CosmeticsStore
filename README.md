## About the project
<p>"Diana Cosmetics" aims to computerize the Salon Beauty Products Management of an online store by creating software that is user-friendly, basic, fast, and cost-effective for personal use, as well as allowing for rapid data processing. The basic shopping solution is the shopping cart system. The application's fundamental concept is to allow consumers to shop virtually through the internet and to purchase items.

This project is a mobile-based shopping system for a retail store that already exists. The project's goal is to port an online shopping app to the Android platform.

This project aims to provide customers of a physical store with the benefits of online shopping. It allows you to buy goods in a store from anywhere in the world using an Android device and the 
internet. As a result, the customer would be able to shop online and have his purchases delivered to his residence from his favorite store.

If retailers provide an online portal through which their customers can shop conveniently from anywhere, they will not lose customers to popular online retailers such as eBay or Alibaba. The application is readily accessible and always available because it is available on a Smartphone.</p>

### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
